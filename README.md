## Smart Pomodoro Project
By Daniel Dublin, Nir Meghbein, Keren Guez 
  
## Details about the project:
The project aims to make the Pomodoro learning technique more tangible and accessible. Instead of relying solely on apps or standard timers, the system will integrate a colored lamp, speaker or buzzer, an optional display screen, and physical buttons to help users monitor and manage their study sessions. The system is designed to support learners in staying focused and consistent as they work toward their exam goals.
